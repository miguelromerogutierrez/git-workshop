## What is git?
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

## Pull | Push
_Pull_: Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch. This command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. The git pull command is actually a combination of two other commands, git fetch followed by git merge.
_Push_: Update remote refs along with associated objects
